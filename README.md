# Titanic Dataset Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to identify patterns in passenger survival rates. Using Python data analysis libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, this notebook explores factors that influenced who survived the sinking of the Titanic.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis of survival rates by passenger class, sex, and age
- Multiple visualization types (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots)
- Correlation analysis between different factors

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure you have all required packages installed
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `titanic_analysis.ipynb`

## Key Findings
- Women had significantly higher survival rates than men
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in lower classes
- Children under 12 had better survival rates than adults
- There's a strong correlation between ticket fare and survival probability
